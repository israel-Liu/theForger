## 1 Programming Patterns
A pattern is a way to describe and address by name.


### 2 Creational Patterns
Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
Same construction process can create different objects representations.

2.4 Singleton
