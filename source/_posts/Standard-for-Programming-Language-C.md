4. [Unnamed namespaces in a translation unit have the same identifier this identifier differs from all other identifiers in the translation unit. In addition, all names declared in unnamed namespace or a namespace within an unnamed namespace, even ones explicitly declared extern, have internal linkage.](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/namespace)
6. [Input/output library](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io) std::basic_streambuf store data std::basic_ios operator.(write log class)
7. [Strings library](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string) Null-terminated strings is string array, std::char_traits provide charT operator.

### Classes
10.[plain old data](https://www.cppfans.org/1431.html) A POD struct109 is a non-union class that is both a trivial class and a standard-layout class, and has no   
non-static data members of type non-POD struct, non-POD union (or array of such types). Similarly, a POD   
union is a union that is both a trivial class and a standard-layout class, and has no non-static data members   
of type non-POD struct, non-POD union (or array of such types). A POD class is a class that is either a POD struct or a POD union.
```Cpp
[ Example:

struct N { // neither trivial nor standard-layout
	int i;
	int j;
	virtual ~N();
};

struct T { // trivial but not standard-layout
	int i;
	private:
	int j;
};

struct SL { // standard-layout but not trivial
	int i;
	int j;
	~SL();
};

struct POD { // both trivial and standard-layout
	int i;
	int j;
};

â€”end example ]
