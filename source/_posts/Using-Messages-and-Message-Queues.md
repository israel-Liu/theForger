#### [Creating a Message Loop](https://msdn.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/windows/desktop/ms644928".aspx)
The system does not automatically create a message queue for each thread. Instead, the system creates a message queue only for threads that perform   operations which require a message queue. If the thread creates one or more windows, a message loop must be provided; this message loop retrieves messages   from the thread's message queue and dispatches them to the appropriate window procedures.  

Because the system directs messages to individual windows in an application, a thread must create at least one window before starting its message loop.    Most applications contain a single thread that creates windows. A typical application registers the window class for its main window, creates and shows the   main window, and then starts its message loop â€” all in the WinMain function.  

You create a message loop by using the GetMessage and DispatchMessage functions. If your application must obtain character input from the user,          include the TranslateMessage function in the loop. TranslateMessage translates virtual-key messages into character messages. The following example shows the   message loop in the WinMain function of a simple Windows-based application.
